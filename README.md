### A Floods Early Warning System based on SMS messages

![ATI logo][ATI]

## Mission
This project looks forward to warning about an upcoming flood for the people in vulnerable situations so they react as soon as possible.
We are deeply motivated by the [Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1.5, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld).
We focused on a local city: Comodoro Rivadavia, Chubut, Argentina, because it has been severely damaged recently by a huge flood, and it wasnâ€™t the first time in the past history. The topology of the surroundings and the increasing of rains as a result of the climate change make this city a vulnerable one for the present and future time.

## How it works
The system uses data from The Weather Company and runs Machine Learning algorithms to make a forecast of the probability of floods in the next 12 hours. In particular, it takes in measurements of the temperature, barometric pressure, wind direction and clouds shape to make predictions based on an Artificial Intelligence model trained with historical data of the region. When the output probability is too high, it broadcasts a warning SMS message to every single cell phone in the local community using the antennas already installed.

## The message
The warning message provides information on shelter locations for people as well as livestock. It also gives critical advice on leaving their belongings at home and moving around the town.
